# Library-Management-System

# Project Idea: Library Management System

1. CLI Application
Functionality: Users can add, update, delete, and search for books. They can also manage member information and track book loans.
Real-world Problem: Helps libraries manage their inventory and member information efficiently.

2. Database with SQLAlchemy ORM
Tables:
Books: id, title, author, genre, year_published
Members: id, name, email, membership_date
Loans: id, book_id, member_id, loan_date, return_date

Relationships:
One-to-Many: A book can have multiple loans.
One-to-Many: A member can have multiple loans.

3. Virtual Environment with Pipenv
Setup: Use Pipenv to manage dependencies and create a virtual environment.
Dependencies: SQLAlchemy, click (for CLI), pipenv

4. Proper Package Structure:
library_management/
├── cli.py
├── models.py
├── database.py
├── __init__.py
└── Pipfile


5. Use of Lists, Dicts, and Tuples
Lists: Store search results or lists of books/members.
Dicts: Store configuration settings or map book genres to descriptions.
Tuples: Use for fixed collections of data, like book details.
